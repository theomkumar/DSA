/*
Nodes  : entity to store data
& edges : connection nodes
Types:
1. directed -> one direction of edges 
2. undirected -> both direction

Degree = no of edges connected to the node
in case of directed we in-degree & out-degree    

->weighted graph: default weight if not mentioned is unit weight i.e 1
-> path: sequence of node from point p to q

Cyclic could be wighted
-> cyclic directed graph: forming cycle
-> acyclic directed graph:

GRAPH
1. Adjacency matrix : using 2-D matrix to represent graph of n nodes, SC: O(N^2)

2. Adjacency List
